I despise 'game:HttpGet' so I rather you use 'httpget' or the below script;

Zynic Hub:
```
-- do not spam this only run it once and wait for it to load
-- if it takes too long check ur conslose for errors if there aren't any then try again
-- PC/Table mode only

local response = request({
	Url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zyn-ic/MM2-AutoFarm/main/FreeScript.lua",
	Method = "GET",
})

loadstring(response.Body)()
```

Basic Autofarm script:
```
-- do not spam this only run it once and wait for it to load
-- if it takes too long check ur conslose for errors if there aren't any then try again
-- PC/Table mode only

local response = request({
	Url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zyn-ic/MM2-AutoFarm/refs/heads/main/Zynic-Auto-Farm/source.lua",
	Method = "GET",
})

loadstring(response.Body)()
```

Fully Auto-Auto Farm:
```
-- do not spam this only run it once and wait for it to load
-- if it takes too long check ur conslose for errors if there aren't any then try again
-- PC/Table mode only

local response = request({
	Url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zyn-ic/MM2-AutoFarm/refs/heads/main/FullAuto/Source.lua",
	Method = "GET",
})

loadstring(response.Body)()
```

# Disclaimer
I noticed my script has be forked and used in a lot of the newer mm2 autofarm scripts to find the closet coin and I'm kinda honored cause before I uploaded the free script back in summer 2024 autofarms were just collecting any random coin that spawned into the map and I did the same thing until I watched some youtube and found crushfire's video on Octree and from there the script was born. Sadly I had a lot to do in college so I couldn't update the script to be better but on my winter break in a mere two days I made an updated version which wouldn't have you go to coins outside the map or "false positions" as I used to call it. Then in I think 4 or 5 days I created the [Free Script](/FreeScript.lua) which is a mm2 hub. I WILL NOT BE UPDATING the hub and will focus on better techniques/functions to [collect coins](/Zynic-Auto-Farm/source.lua);
- [x] faster
- [x] safer
- [x] smarter
- [x] and accout for all werid possibilities (like a murderer killing you while you're tweening to a coin)

## Basic Features

* Increase/Decrease walkspeed
* TP to player
* Refresh Roles [^1]
* Rejoin
* Server Hop
* Destroy gui

## Advance Features
* Autofarm
* Murderer/Sheriff Info [^2]
* Get Gun [^3]
* Fling Murderer

[^1]: used to refresh roles manually
[^2]: will refresh role automatically but is as acurate as I need it to be
[^3]: safe gun is a setting feature for get gun. It's purpose is to make sure you're not too far from the gun when getting it.


# Potential Updates:
* implement crushfire's [scheduler class module](https://youtu.be/jGIomP26RRQ?si=0ba7S9dpC5fKFPfl) to see if that would reduce the coroutine usage[^4]
[^4]: I'm not the best with coroutines
